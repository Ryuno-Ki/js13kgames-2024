# 2024-09-03

I slowly get the hang of RDF. I figured out how to describe the characters and
locations in my world as well as items. Now I need to better understand how to
handle interactions. This is adding quite some keys to the facts property.
I feel like it has less to do with logic reasoning and more about filtering the
object for certain properties (usually URIs as strings that map to keys on the
facts property) and then returning the matching slice.

Quite verbose, but I want to see whether I gain something from it. It has all
the parts I need for self-steered intelligence I want to assign the characters.

A couple decades ago the research called these Expert Systems and presented it
as an alternative to stochastic approaches. It is a LOT of work but perhaps
worth it. Especailly for a small game.

By bringing up the idea to apply ValueFlows to a game and running with the AI
category (NLP by parsing a prompt, expressing plans inside the game and
similar) I learned about an [Economic Sentence Structure][ess] (ESS) that turns
text into JSX. I gave it a read. While it sounds interesting (and reminds me
on other small Domain-Specific Languages) it is to unintuitive for this game.

I could have special syntax. But I want to use word order to actual steer the
possible continuings. It will be a back and forth between the text input and
the populated list of suggestions. This would allow for more creativity with
a nudging into what's possible. The challenge is to come up with the first
word. Perhaps I should handle „help”?

Sleeping over the name generator of yesterday I realised that I could on chance
generate a name of length 0. Not what I want. I should look up how to define
a lower boundary (that can be 0 if I want to pick an item from the whole list
by random).

After this giant refactoring I finished today I was curious whether I am still
within the limits. It felt so much. So I cheated by not tooting it today.

I was able to check off a couple of todos within this journal. Felt so good!

## Today's achievement

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟩🟩 7.18 KiB / 13 KiB #js13k #js13kgames
The file is 7351 bytes (5961 bytes under the limit).

Only 478 bytes more!

### Setup

Handle quantities.

## Next step

- [ ] Use RDF to describe transfer of items.
