# 2024-08-18

I had an hour or two today to refactor a little bit of code. It bugged me that
the prompt input repeatedly loosing focus. My first line of thought was that I
should not render the whole tree. So I broke the current level into three
smaller components.

That didn't result in a different behaviour. Digging deeper into the change
detection that causes a rebuild of components I realised that setting the
`value` attribute was triggering it. Of course!
That's what I omitted in the other cases.

Earlier today I also read about computer linguistics to get a better idea on
how I should structure the code. There's something called the [„Pipeline Model
of Saarbrücken”][saarbruecken]. I only found an explanation in German. Thus I'm
outlining the steps here:

1. Speech detection: transcribe audio into text
2. Tokenisation: Segment strings into sentences, words etc.
3. Morphologic analysis: Analyse grammar and transform words to their base form
4. Syntactic analysis: Analyse each word for their structural function (SVO)
5. Semantic analysis: Associate meaning to sentences
6. Dialogue and discourse analysis: Recognise relationship between sentences

I can simplify it to a degree. I don't have speech recognition. I have high
control about the tokens because I dictate the sentences (to a degree, think
Mad Libs). I'm not completely sure on the morphologic analysis because the
suggested prompts could be ignored. I think I will combine the handling with a
state chart of sorts to handle „invalid” cases. There will only be one syntax
used everywhere. I don't have the size for more in this jam. Semantics is
basically picking the right command and options from a prompt. Perhaps also
tweaking some numbers.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff a829ded49664d3e2f582994584a12da227d74c34 to da342f35959f18ee4033500783a3dfc5605e6451][diff]

🟥🟥🟥🟩🟩🟩 4.78 KiB / 13 KiB #js13k #js13kgames
The file is 4893 bytes (8419 bytes under the limit).

37 bytes up compared with the last record.

### Setup

Now since I have a smooth rendering, I should write tests to have a guarantee
that it will stay this way before moving on.

## Next step

Stub out the first world.

### Codewise
