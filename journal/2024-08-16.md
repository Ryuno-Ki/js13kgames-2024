# 2024-08-16

Today was a short session. I watched some videos on how others implemented
text based adventures like [Zork][zork]. It boils down to accepting a text
input field, breaking words on spaces, treating the first word as command and
the rest as options to that command. Next usually the state is managed as a
collection of objects with well-defined properties that are present for every
room. That's doable.

This „AI” circus (especially generative AI) is going wild on prompts, so let's
give 'em a text input. As a twist I can populate a `datalist` with suggestions
on how to complete a prompt. I will focus on [SVO word order][svo] for the
most part, because English is structured like this. For the prompt input, the
subject is going to be always the player and can therefore be omitted (or
rather: filled in by the game engine).

The easiest command I can think of is `go`. TypeScript can help me enforce
valid object structures to a degree without blowing up the bundle code (because
JSDoc comments rule).

I commented the melody code path (so it gets treeshaken) because it is jarring
as long as I don't connect it to the Store.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 01d715af0f7ba6508835cbd5fbe7409b5ecb3bfe to 40e2be55f4485c38f3eec0b1a9ddcef7a6830c41][diff]

🟥🟥🟥🟩🟩🟩 4.74 KiB / 13 KiB #js13k #js13kgames
The file is 4856 bytes (8456 bytes under the limit).

A little bit imprecise because I commented the music code so it is stripped.

### Setup

I have the minimum parser in place. There's more work to reflect it in the
game screen.

## Next step

Think about how I want to bind the interface to the prompts.

### Codewise
