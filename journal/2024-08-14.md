# 2024-08-14

I had a soso sleep. Naturally my mind was spinning around what kind of game I
could develop. Fear of the 13 makes me think of an obsession with counting.
I feel quite uneasy with making ‚Äûfun‚Äù of people with obsessions. Perhaps the
game entry is going to be more grim to act respectful towards mention with
these mental disorders.

When I stylise the 13 enough the `1` could become a scythe and the `3` to a
reaper. Once my course was over I went searching for images and found some:

- [Scythe on Indonesian Wikipedia][scythe_id]
- [Scythe on Simple English Wikipedia][scythe_simple]
- [Scythe sketch on Deviantart][deviant_sketch]
- [Scythe on Deviantart][deviant_scythe]

Those look amazing. Using grayscale allows me for easier tracing them if I
decide to turn them into a SVG.

But that's not all. I mentioned [yesterday][yesterday] that there was this
componist who had a fear of 13. So I recalled to have worked with Web Audio API
in a previous entry and went looking. Sure enough, back in 2020 I had a
[game with music][js13k_2020] and could port the code over. I researched some
more on the API and read guides. The Web.Dev team haven't added a note but the
[API changed][migration]. It's no longer `noteOn()` but `start()` nowadays.

The tutorials on MDN with white noise worked ‚Ä¶ okay, but sound noisy (that's
the point). So I copied one of the different scores I wrote back then to fit
into the current approach and smoothed a little over. References I left for
myself died. But there is another great overview for
[mapping notes to frequencies][mapping] I found online. Perhaps I should write
that table down on my own website?

With that code in place I looked into the scores again. I learned that the
play I had in mind was an Orchestra with many instruments but started out as a
sextett for string instruments. Sure enough there were [scores][scores] for
those as well.

Then I looked into ABC notation again (which I simplified for my game) and
found a [blog explainer][explainer] as well as a [documentation][documentation]
online. I prefer reading over watching videos.

I was falling into a rabbit hole on audio filters but then the Internet was
cut down as it is every evening on workdays as a measure for my family to get
enough sleep (don't laugh! It works.).

So I went to bed. With the scores and the book I was thinking about whether I
should check them into version control. Ultimately I want to port them over to
ABC notation in code, but I am not aware of the timeframe yet. So yeah, I did
that and had to update the REUSE.toml accordingly. Which led me to the
question which SPDX identifier to use for Public Domain. According to the
REUSE FAQ it is CC0-1.0 which [matches their explaination][cc0]. The GNU Free
Documentation License used for the ABC PDF was not exactly denoted, but looking
up the provided link and matching them with the `-only` suffix yielded a
match so I'm guessing it is that.

Finally I wanted to have some colour in my journal, so I looked up how I tooted
them because ùïè (formerly known as Twitter) is dead. I deleted my profile there
and have no intentions on going back.
However I was looking at my code from 2022 and found a script that tooted on
Mastodon. I still have a profile there but running an own GoToSocial instance
by now. From a previous experiment I knew it had a compatible API so all I
needed to figure out was how to get a token.
GoToSocial documented the [required steps for an OAuth dance][oauth]. A little
bit more involved but doable.

Check out the [migration guide][masto] as masto.js changed its API in response
to tighter controls on Mastodon. I like that.

With that I completed what I set out to do on the 14th August.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 8a1acb39bacf526840e4fd7ddd08493abfefc624 to 01c3a16b236ec7e6278485a4342bd4c67828cdf9][diff]

The file is 4276 bytes (9036 bytes under the limit)

Plenty of space!

### Setup

I ported over the code for using Web Audio API, cleaned it up and extended it
a little bit.

## Next step

I want to play around with the graphics. Perhaps look into procedural
generation? The NPC idea makes me think about semantics. I had something in
that direction but did not invest enough time to follow it through back then.
