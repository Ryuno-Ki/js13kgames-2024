# 2024-09-02

I got the name generator working! Basically it is interweaving consonants and
vowels. This would make it sound Japanese-like, but I have a couple more
consonants. Aside, Japanese has a consonant that can end a word without a
vowel following it („n”).

I then refactored the code to have a variable length of the name.

## Today's achievement

Actually I have something but I couldn't commit because it became part of a
larger refactoring that I couldn't finish on the same day.

### Setup

Finish up the refactoring.

## Next step

- [ ] Use RDF to describe transfer of items.
