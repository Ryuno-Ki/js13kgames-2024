# 2024-08-15

I was enjoying the weather outside today and met some people. Therefore very
little progress on the game today.

I was considering adding some kind of platforming. But that requires a physics
engine and focus on performance for smooth animations. Not what I have much
experience in. So I will explore a click & point adventure. Perhaps around a
small town. With parties that other people are invited to. That could have an
unfortunate number. That could lean into QuatorziÃ¨me. See further
[fin de siÃ¨cle][wiki].

I went to Openmoji and picked some emoji that appeared to be fitting.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 2cb2eb7643092ca5b9089e3a31f5cdb926ea2951 to 7aec0f2e7c1f317da151779648fcd24fa4ad084f][diff]

The file is 4892 bytes (8420 bytes under the limit).

I bar filled compared to [yesterday][yesterday].

### Setup

I was surprised that the `.sr-only` approach did not apply to SVG `tspan`.
I filled the text with transparency to paint over it.

## Next step

Look into some basic semantics of sentences to have kind of prompts that will
control how the people in the town behave.
