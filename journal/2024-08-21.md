# 2024-08-21

My course took away most of my energy so I did some cleanup and included the
melody file again. Therefore my code grew a little. I haven't found the best
place to put the import yet. I must wait for an user interaction before I can
play back music. At the same time, the volume should be part of the state.
Finally I want to have a single playback.

Maybe I'm holding it wrong.

## Today's achievement

游린游린游린游릴游릴游릴 5.40 KiB / 13 KiB #js13k #js13kgames
The file is 5534 bytes (7778 bytes under the limit).

### Setup

Need to research music handling better. Perhaps I can use a data URI with an
`<audio>` element?

## Next step

Deploy a playable version.
