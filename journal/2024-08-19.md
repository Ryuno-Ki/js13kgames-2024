# 2024-08-19

Today was another school day so I hadn't too much time to work on the game.
It didn't help that a Windows update broke my bootloader (I figured out how to
get into my system now).

I wrote tests for the refactoring to have a way to keep the current
implementation as well as have a foundation on how other features shall behave.

## Today's achievement

Nothing.

### Setup

I should drop the world selection, win and gameover scenes. I feel like those
don't make sense. I also would like to access the settings scenes from the
level.

## Next step

Stub out the first world.

### Codewise

- [ ] Stub out the game world
