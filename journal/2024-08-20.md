Back when I started to learn more about programming languages, I heard about
[Prolog][prolog] - a programming language for [Logic Programming][logic].

During the research of this jam I even spotted a
[Prolog interpreter in JS][tau] - but I assume it will be oversized for what I
am going to need.

So instead I roll my own flavour.

Logic programming consists of facts on the world, clauses that combine clauses
and queries that are ran over them. So if I track my facts in the state and
write functions for clauses I could have reducers doing the query part. Kind
of. It doesn't have to be perfect. After all, we have a size constraint here.

So today I refactored my code to try it out. The size grew a bit, but I'm not
in the optimisation phase. I should keep an eye on it and look closer towards
the last part of the bar below.

## Today's achievement

游린游린游린游릴游릴游릴 5.17 KiB / 13 KiB #js13k #js13kgames
The file is 5292 bytes (8020 bytes under the limit).

A little more than I expected but I rather have it this way then optimising it
now and panic towards the end.

### Setup

The scenes feel really annoying here. Should be my focus this week.

## Next step

Include a [RNG][rng] for pseudo-random decision making. See GameDevJS 2023
entry.
Have the scene update with different rooms. Show an inventory.

### Codewise

- [ ] Show a room.
- [ ] Place an inventory onto the screen.
