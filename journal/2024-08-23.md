# 2024-08-23

Yesterday I tested my game on my Android mobile using Firefox. I was
disappointed to not see the suggestions come up. Turns out I hit an
[six years old bug][bug]. Okay, very well then. What workarounds can I apply.
There's this amazing library by Lea Verou called [Awesomplete][awesomplete]
which does a little too much for my taste. If I weren't glancing at the final
file size I would have gone with that one.

In the end I went with an [HTML4 approach][html4] that I adapted to my
architecture. That should get the job done fine.

My lunch break had me watching videos on how people define RDF ontologies.
After all one category is about „AI” so I should have a way to describe
„things” in a way for machines to understand. Semantic Web relies on the
Ressource Description Framework (RDF) for that. But my past experience with it
involved a lot of XML, JSON-LD or this Turtle file format (human readable but
it would require me to have a parser in the project). One presentation I
watched mentioned [RDF-JSON][rdfjson] which was let down in favour of JSON-LD
but looks simple enough to be included:

```json
{
  "subject": {
    "predicate": [
      {
        "value": "URI | Lexical Value | Blank Node",
        "type": "uri | literal | bnode",
        "lang": "two-character-language-code if literal",
        "datatype": "datatype URI if literal"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See? Easy!

Now, I mentioned „Subject Verb Object” word order before. This is similar.
In fact, it is so common in RDF that the structure is referred to as triplets.
They form a graph with a subject and object as nodes and a predicate as edge
pointing from subject to object (in other words: a directed graph, likely to
be acyclic, too).

The question becomes: where do I get my vocabulary that defines the meaning
of the parts? Well, these are called Ontologies. There are some more known ones
like [Dublin Core][dc] or [Friend of a Friend][foaf]. In the web world, chances
are [schema.org][schema] was used in SEO. But I also found people making up
there own ones. For example to define [colours][cyannotation]. I played around
with [ValueFlows][vf] in the past but could not make head or tails from it.
That is, until I watched a presentation by Lynn Foster when i could see it in
action. (I don't have the link at hand right now).

How do I prevent collisions of terms by all these ontologies?

Now, the code snippet above talked about URIs. Those are similar to URLs.
In practice I often see them abbreviated to a `prefix:suffix` notation. By
that, the reference becomes unique (the prefix points to the ontology and the
suffix to the concrete thing you are referencing). The mapping from prefix to
ontology is usually done at the beginning of file. There have been some
conventions but in principle you can call them whatever you want.

I took a look at an [npm package on schema.org][npm] to help me get an idea of
how I would structure my code before I rope in another library. There you can
find `domain` and `range` come up repeatedly. Reading [RDF Schema][rdfs]:

I interpret that as when I would write

```js
class Book {
    /** @type {Person} */
    author: '';
}
```

I can express that as in RDF as

```json
{
  "eg:Book": {
    "eg:author": [
      {
        "type": "uri",
        "value": "eg:Person"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The interesting part will be functions. Not only properties that describe an
object but also a change to them. In a way these are similar to actions in my
Redux-like architecture. Instead of modifying the state I can describe the
change and have a reducer translating it into a new state.

Finally, in the past I used to use the [OpenLink Structured Data Sniffer][osds]
for inspecting the semantics, but I noticed it included ChatGPR in a recent
update. I'm not okay with that. Looks like I need some other tooling to help
me understand RDF better.

Lastly I added `esm-seedrandom` as a Pseudo Random Number Generator today.
I was a little puzzled as to why I always receive the same value for

```js
import { prng_alea } from "esm-seedrandom";

const rng = prng_alea(state.seed);
console.log(rng.quick());
```

only to eventually realise that if I define the same seed I receive the same
number. Works as designed. My reducer would need to define a new seed on each
application as a consequence.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 5754c2cc8868876784a6eef773d40f2b6031c26d to af00b71b5578b52f1ec4a12e613ad4eb4033e4da][diff]

🟥🟥🟥🟥🟩🟩 6.59 KiB / 13 KiB #js13k #js13kgames
The file is 6747 bytes (6565 bytes under the limit).

Ui, another element filled. Now I should start focussing on actual gameplay.

### Setup

Move things around so that the screen actually invites to explore.

## Next step

- [ ] Make use of RDF.
